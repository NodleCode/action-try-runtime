- [ ] set outputs to something useful if possible

## Development

### Upgrading to a another version of `try-runtime`

> By convention please follow the release numbers from [Parity's repo](https://github.com/paritytech/try-runtime-cli).

1. Run the [prebuild github action](https://github.com/NodleCode/action-try-runtime/actions/workflows/base-image.yml) to pre-build `try-runtime`. Pass it the latest version from parity's repo (for example `v0.6.1`).
2. Wait for the action to build succesfully, which will take a little while.
3. Update the first line in the action [`Dockerfile`](./Dockerfile) to use the version number of the new prebuilt container (in this example `v0.6.1`).
4. Draft a new github release for the same version number (`v0.6.1` in this example).
5. You may now use the newly release and built action in your CI/CD pipeline.

> We prebuild a docker container with `try-runtime` to ensure Github does not rebuilt `try-runtime` everytime we use this action, thus giving us a nice speed improvement.

### Troubleshooting

Verify online version

```
docker run  ghcr.io/nodlecode/try-runtime-cli:v0.6.1 try-runtime  -V
```

Execute the prebuilt docker image

```
docker run -v ~/nodle/chain/snapshots:/snapshots ghcr.io/nodlecode/try-runtime-cli:v0.6.1 try-runtime --runtime ./snapshots/runtime_eden.wasm   on-runtime-upgrade  snap -p snapshots/eden-ci
```

Build and run image locally
```
cd base
docker build --build-arg VERSION=v0.6.1  . -t milkman -f ./Dockerfile

docker run milkman try-runtime --version
docker run milkman try-runtime --help
docker run -v ~/nodle/chain/snapshots:/snapshots milkman try-runtime --runtime ./snapshots/runtime_eden.wasm   on-runtime-upgrade  snap -p snapshots/eden-ci
```
